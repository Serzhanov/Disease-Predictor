DataBase : MySql
Currently,I am creating a Website where going to be implemeted this Disease-Predictor.

- I will add the CRUD for database to register user/doctor.
- I will provide an API to search/call the near hospital.
- I should search more data and increase the outcome of my ML
- I will add the DeepLearning Model(NLP && RNN) to analyse the text and detect if the user has the problems with health.

I hope this app will save the time of many doctors
